    <h1>Top 3 Coolest Items in Fortnite</h1>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>These are the top 3 coolest items in my opinion. That's all.</p>
    <h2>1. Demogorgon</h2>

    <p>I think this skin is pretty cool because it represents an important character from the show Stranger Things. It looks basic at first glance, but it has more features than meets the eye. This skin can open its head/mouth in certain situations, revealing a bunch of sharp teeth. Not many other skins can do this sort of thing, which makes this one pretty unique and awesome. This skin may never come back to the item shop, too, which makes it one of the rarest items in Fortnite.</p>
    <h2>2. Lavawing</h2>

    <p>This glider is one of my favorites as it contains so much detail to it. It's also pretty cool to ride a dragon. This dragon spits fire while you glide, instilling fear within opponents before you even land. This is also a very rare glider, which only adds onto its coolness.</p>
    <h2>3. Demon Skull</h2>
    <img src="media/demonskull.jpg" width="600" height="491" alt="Demon Skull">
    <p>The Demon Skull pickaxe is very cool as it's very detailed and it's very rare. It hasn't come back onto the item shop in over a year. Unlike the other two items here, this one isn't included in a set. It's just a random pickaxe. It's very noticeable in game, so it's a good item to show off with if you're not afraid of being spotted by an opponent off in the distance.</p>
    <h2>BONUS!</h2>
    <p>Here's an audio file of the Demon Skull pickaxe being swung:</p>
